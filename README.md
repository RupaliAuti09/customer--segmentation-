# customer--segmentation-

In this project,We were provided with an unlabeled dataset
on the transaction details of online retail
customers. All the transactions were
occurring between 01/12/2010 and
09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered
non-store online retail. The company mainly
sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many
customers of the company were wholesalers.
Our task was to explore and analyze the data
and to build a clustering model for customer
segmentation.
